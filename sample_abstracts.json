Additional information from engineers and scientists about the nature of the dam's structural problems and the cost of repair would also be incorporated into our final recommendations. Through various methods of research and interviews (community round tables; public meetings; and interviews with community members; engineers; and scientists) we constructed three different proposals that included research on the economic; environmental; and community impact:. Our final recommendations included: complete repair of the dam; creation of a lakeside park; and drainage of the reservoir and construction of a shopping mall. We learned a deal about the complexities and importance of working together (different perspectives and skills) in conjunction with the community members to create something that was useful to the community.

The purpose of this study is to review current literature to determine the potential benefits of incorporating a structured Pilates-style exercise program within traditional therapies for PTSD. During the first phase; we examine the emotional; cognitive and physical symptoms of patients with post-traumatic stress disorder due to sexual assault and abuse. The second phase reviews current treatment models traditional and alternative to determine their efficacy in treating the wide-range of somatic PTSD symptoms. Finally; the study compares the therapeutic needs of PTSD patients with the espoused benefits of Pilates to determine the potential efficacy of incorporating a structured Pilates program into current treatment models. Due to its focus on mind-body awareness and stress reduction; Pilates appears to complement current treatment models for post-traumatic preliminary review of the current literature suggests that adding Pilates as an adjunct treatment may help patients achieve desired states of relaxation; attune to internal sensations; and improve body image and overall physical health.",
