## Floating and stilt houses in Agusan Marsh, Philippines: Vernacular architecture and water urbanism in the 21st century

Isidoro R. Malaque III' and Rachel Mae P. Sitcharon? University of the Philippines Mindanao; Davao City, Philippines irmalaqueiii@up.edu.ph' , 0000-0002-8757-50471 Provincial Government of Agusan del Sur, Prosperidad, Agusan del Sur, Philippines rpsitcharon@gmail com?, 0009-0007-5785-22112

Abstract: To further   study vernacular and   indigenous architecture as man-made environment complementing the dynamism of marsh ecosystem in the context of 21st century influences, this case study investigated the houses in La Flora, Talacogon, Agusan del Sur, Philippines. Other than the typologies of floating houses, stilt houses and houses combining stilt and floating technologies were also found in La Flora. In this area, floating houses are situated along the main Agusan river and in the tributary Mayat river. These houses can float all throughout the year, but during season, some are sitting on land near river banks. Stilt houses that is the most common type were constructed with stilt heights in accordance to the various water levels during annual flood recurrences. The third type are houses that will function as stilt houses during dry season but will float with the bamboo floaters inserted below the main during flooding: Shown in the use of building materials and design variations, the 21st century influences are reflected. Finally, with this century's issues and concerns on climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction management, this study is hoped to inspire new insights towards sustainable development strategies for cities and other regions. dry floor
